The dataset that I chose was given by Maryland Small Business Development Center (SBDC). This  organization provides sound advice, consulting and support to entrepreneurs and small businesses  across the state, since 1988. They do this to make a positive impact on the community. The dataset that  the organization has provided, lists the people who participated in at least one group training event  during the last 5 years, describing the attendeesâ€™ demographics, and the specifies topic and format of  the training events. The organization is interested in identifying the historical market of its training  attendees and appropriate training topics of interest. The purpose for such analysis is for SBDC to target  the right audience with the right training topics. The following factors were examined and analyzed:  
1. Gender  
2. Race  
3. Demographic/Geographical clusters (location of attendees)  
4. Date  
5. Topics (primary topics)  
6. Business status  
Using pandas on jupyter to code and excel spreadsheets to create the graphs it was found that while  some topics are more popular than others, it seems that women make up most participants, and overall,  they are mostly African American or Caucasian. In almost all counties, the number of women seem to  surpass that of men. Surprisingly more people prefer to attend sessions in person, despite how much  more accessible technology allows for online sessions. Topics that focus on general business  management such as Accounting/Budgeting, Business Planning, Business Start-Up/Planning, Legal  Issues, etc. seem to be the most popular among all genders and races. As far as locations are concerned,  counties such as Frederick, Montgomery, Prince George and Anne Arundel, seemed to have most  participants who attended webinars where the rest fall under the mass majority favoring seminars. In  almost all counties, the number of women seem to surpass that of men.
